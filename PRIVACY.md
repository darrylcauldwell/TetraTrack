# TetraTrack Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 11 February 2026

TetraTrack is built with privacy at its core. This policy explains what data the app accesses, how it is used, and your choices.

## Data Collection

TetraTrack does **not** collect, transmit, or sell your personal data to any third party. There are no third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking frameworks in the app.

All training data (rides, runs, swims, shooting sessions, competitions, and horse profiles) is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.

## iCloud Sync (CloudKit)

If you are signed in to iCloud, your training data syncs automatically across your devices via Apple's CloudKit private database. This data is stored in **your** iCloud account and is not accessible to the developer or any third party. Apple's iCloud terms and privacy policy govern this storage.

## HealthKit

TetraTrack can read and write workout data to Apple Health with your explicit permission. This includes heart rate, distance, calories, and workout summaries. HealthKit data is never sent off your device by TetraTrack. You can revoke HealthKit access at any time in Settings > Health > TetraTrack.

## Location Data

TetraTrack uses your location during active riding, running, and open-water swimming sessions to record routes and calculate distances. Location tracking only occurs while you are actively recording a session. Location data is stored locally and synced to your iCloud account if iCloud sync is enabled. It is never shared with the developer or third parties.

## Apple Intelligence Features

AI-powered features (coaching summaries, gait detection, trend analysis) run entirely on-device using Apple's FoundationModels framework. No training data is sent to external servers for AI processing.

## Family Live Sharing

If you enable Live Sharing, your real-time location during active sessions is shared with family members you explicitly invite via CloudKit shared zones. You control who can see your location and can stop sharing at any time.

## Camera and Photo Library

TetraTrack can link photos and videos from your Apple Photos library to training sessions and competitions. The app accesses photo references only; it does not copy or upload your media.

## Data Retention

All your data remains on your device and in your iCloud account. Deleting the app removes local data. To remove iCloud data, use Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > Manage Storage.

## Children's Privacy

TetraTrack does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is suitable for all ages under parental guidance.

## Changes to This Policy

Updates to this policy will be posted in this file and reflected in the app's App Store listing. The effective date at the top will be updated accordingly.

TetraTrack is a multi-discipline training app for tetrathlon and eventing athletes.

LOCATION PERMISSION: The app requests location access to record GPS routes during riding, running, and open water swimming sessions. Background location is used so tracking continues when the screen locks during active exercise sessions. The app uses CLBackgroundActivitySession (iOS 17+) for fitness tracking.

HEALTHKIT: Used to save workouts to Apple Health and read heart rate data from Apple Watch during sessions.

CAMERA: Used to scan shooting target cards and detect shot holes for scoring.

MICROPHONE: Used for hands-free voice notes during training sessions (e.g. while riding).

APPLE WATCH: The Watch companion app provides glove-friendly controls for starting/stopping sessions, viewing live stats, and heart rate monitoring.

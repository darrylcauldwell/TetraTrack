What's New in Version 0.0.123

BACKGROUND GPS — FIXED FOR GOOD

The big one. GPS tracking now works reliably when your phone screen locks during riding, running, and open water swimming sessions. No more starting a hack, locking your phone, and returning to find only 4 metres of data. Background tracking now works with "When In Use" location permission — no need for "Always Allow".

• Riding sessions continue recording GPS, gait, and all sensor data through screen lock
• Running sessions maintain location and motion tracking in background
• Open water swimming keeps GPS tracking active when screen sleeps
• Treadmill sessions maintain Watch heart rate connection through screen lock
• Screen stays awake during active sessions to prevent accidental sleep

SENSOR DATA EXPORT

Export your riding session data for analysis in external tools:
• JSON export with full gait segments, transitions, biomechanics, and GPS points
• CSV export for spreadsheet analysis
• GPX export for route mapping in third-party apps

APP STORE READY

• Added privacy manifest for iOS 17.4+ compliance
• Export compliance declaration included
• Crash-resistant data handling improvements

Thanks for riding with us. Every update is shaped by feedback from riders, runners, swimmers, and shooters like you.

Train. Track. Triumph.

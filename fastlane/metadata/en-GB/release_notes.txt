What's New in Version 0.0.17

We've been busy fixing things, adding things, and trying not to break other things. Here's what's new:

PRETTIER PIXELS
• Trusted Contacts got a makeover — cleaner, simpler, works on screens of all sizes (yes, even your mum's phone with the massive text)
• Family Sharing is easier to manage — fewer taps to control who's watching your magnificent canter work

MORE WAYS TO PRETEND YOU'RE TRAINING
Demo data now includes:
• Schooling sessions like "Polework Puzzle" and "Bounce Grid Bootcamp"
• Running horrors including "Hill Repeats (Stairway to Suffering)" and "Sunday Long Run (Pain & Suffering)"
• Swimming adventures from "Lake Adventure (Cold Water Shock)" to "Distance Day (Channel Prep?)"
• Shooting practice with "Under Pressure (Dad Watching)" — we've all been there

NERDY IMPROVEMENTS
• Photos now link to your ENTIRE riding day, not just session time — so that selfie with your horse actually shows up
• Rhythm detection got smarter — we're using ALL the sensors now, not just the easy ones
• "Schooling Scores" explains what rhythm actually means (spoiler: it's about keeping a steady beat, not dancing)

SQUASHED BUGS
• Fixed that thing where photos weren't appearing for schooling rides
• Movement Quality now has explanations a human can understand
• Various invisible improvements that we're very proud of

COMING SOON
• Offline route planning with actual bridleways (no more accidentally routing through someone's garden)
• Dressage test scoring
• Video analysis (the AI will be honest, we can't help that)

Thanks for riding with us. Every update is shaped by feedback from riders, runners, swimmers, and shooters like you.

Train. Track. Triumph.

Your horse just spooked at a plastic bag. Again. But don't worry — TrackRide was still tracking your involuntary canter transition.

Welcome to the only training app that actually gets tetrathlon and eventing. We know you're not just a runner who occasionally sits on a horse, or a swimmer who dabbles in target practice. You're gloriously, chaotically multi-talented — and finally, there's an app for that.

AUTOMATIC GAIT DETECTION (AKA MAGIC)

TrackRide knows when you're walking, trotting, cantering, or executing an unplanned gallop toward the gate. No buttons to press. No "was that a canter or a very enthusiastic trot?" debates. Just ride, and watch your route paint itself in gorgeous gait-coloured glory.

Secretly favouring your left rein? We'll notice. Spending 90% of your "canter fitness session" in walk? The numbers don't lie. But we won't judge — much.

YOUR AI COACH (WHO NEVER GETS TIRED OF YOUR QUESTIONS)

Powered by Apple Intelligence, TrackRide analyses every session and actually tells you something useful:

"Lovely balanced session today! Your rhythm scores are up 15% this week. Maybe add some walk breaks next time — your heart rate was working harder than your horse."

Ask anything: "Show me rides where I worked on collection" or "Why am I always slower on Mondays?" It's like having a coach in your pocket, minus the shouting.

FOUR DISCIPLINES, ONE SLIGHTLY OBSESSIVE APP

• RIDING — GPS tracking, gait detection, balance analysis, turn counting, elevation profiles, and yes, we'll find photos you took mid-hack
• RUNNING — 1500m time trials with virtual pacer (race your ghost!), intervals, treadmill mode for hamster wheel days, and AirPods coaching that reminds you to stop hunching
• SWIMMING — 3-minute test simulation, automatic stroke counting via Apple Watch, SWOLF scores to obsess over, and lap-by-lap breakdowns
• SHOOTING — Competition cards, stance stability tracking (your Watch knows when you're wobbling), dry fire drills, and AI pattern analysis that's surprisingly honest

FAMILY SAFETY (KEEP MUM HAPPY)

Riding alone doesn't mean being alone. Share your live location so family can see exactly where you are, what gait you're in, and panic slightly less.

Fall detection uses a clever 2-phase system — we check for impact, then check if you're still moving. Apple Watch heart rate helps too. If you don't respond, we alert your trusted contacts with your GPS location. Safety first, dramatic dismounts second.

APPLE WATCH: BIG BUTTONS FOR GLOVED FINGERS

We made the buttons huge. Like, comically large. Because we've tried tapping tiny icons in winter gloves and it's not fun. Heart rate zones, gait breakdown, session stats — all on your wrist without fishing your phone out of your pocket.

COMPETITION READY

Track your entire Pony Club season with countdown timers, task checklists (pack the hairnets!), and competition results. Manage multiple horses with profiles, training histories, and smart workload recommendations so you know who's ready to work and who needs a spa day.

PRIVACY FIRST

Your data stays on your devices. Apple Intelligence processes locally. We're not selling your canter statistics to anyone. Promise.

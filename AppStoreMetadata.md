## App Description (4000 characters max)

TrackRide is the complete training companion for tetrathlon, eventing, and multi-discipline athletes. Whether you're schooling in the arena, conditioning on trails, competing in Pony Club events, or training across all four disciplines, TrackRide captures every session and turns it into insights that help you become a better athlete.

**FOUR DISCIPLINES, ONE APP**

• Riding — GPS tracking with automatic gait detection (walk, trot, canter, gallop), turn balance analysis, lead tracking, and beautiful gait-coloured route maps
• Running — 1500m time trials with virtual pacer, interval training, cadence tracking, and voice coaching
• Swimming — 3-minute test simulation, stroke detection via Apple Watch, SWOLF efficiency scoring
• Shooting — Competition card practice, stance stability tracking, dry fire drills with Watch accelerometer feedback

**YOUR AI TRAINING COACH (Apple Intelligence)**

Powered by Apple Intelligence, TrackRide goes beyond tracking to become your intelligent training partner — all processed privately on your device:

• Post-session summaries explaining what went well and what to work on
• Natural language search: "Show me rides where I worked on collection"
• Recovery analysis telling you when you're ready for hard training
• Personalised coaching suggestions based on your patterns

**KEEP YOUR FAMILY SAFE**

Riding alone doesn't mean being alone. Share your live location with family members who can track your route, see your current gait, and receive automatic safety alerts if you stop moving unexpectedly. Advanced fall detection uses a 2-phase algorithm with heart rate integration.

**APPLE WATCH INTEGRATION**

Your Watch becomes your training computer:
• Large glove-friendly buttons for ride control
• Live heart rate streaming with zone indicators
• Discipline-specific displays (hacking, flatwork, cross-country)
• Haptic feedback for gait changes and milestones
• Shooting stance stability measurement
• Swimming stroke detection and counting
• Running form quality indicators

**COMPETITION CALENDAR**

Never miss an event. Track your entire tetrathlon and eventing season with countdown timers, task checklists, and horse assignments. Record results and compare performance across competitions.

**MANAGE MULTIPLE HORSES**

Create detailed profiles for each horse with training history, gait distribution statistics, health notes, and workload recommendations. Photos and videos link from your Apple Photos library.

**VOICE COACHING**

Hands-free audio cues via AirPods keep you informed:
• Distance milestones and pace updates
• Gait change announcements
• Heart rate zone alerts
• Form reminders during running
• AI-powered session summaries read aloud

**INTEGRATIONS**

• Apple Health — Automatic workout export with MET-based calorie calculations
• Strava — One-tap auto-upload
• Garmin Connect & MyFitnessPal — Sync your sessions
• GPX Export — Share your routes

**PRIVACY FIRST**

Your data stays yours. Everything remains on your devices and personal iCloud. Apple Intelligence processes locally — nothing is sent externally. Family sharing is opt-in only.

TrackRide requires iOS 17.0+ and supports Apple Watch with watchOS 10.0+. Apple Intelligence features require iPhone 15 Pro or later with iOS 18.0+.

Train. Track. Triumph.

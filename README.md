## Your Personal AI Coach (Apple Intelligence)

**TrackRide thinks with you.** Powered by Apple Intelligence, TrackRide goes beyond simple tracking to become your intelligent training partner - all processed privately on your device.

### Understand Every Session Instantly (Apple Intelligence)

After each training session, TrackRide tells you what matters in plain English:

> "Strong canter work today with excellent left-right balance. Your rhythm scores have improved 15% this week. Consider more walk breaks next time - your heart rate stayed elevated throughout."

No spreadsheets. No manual analysis. Just clear insights you can act on.

### Ask Questions, Get Answers (Apple Intelligence)

Find any session instantly using natural language:

- "Show me rides where I worked on collection"
- "When did I last do a long hack?"
- "My best swim times this month"
- "Running sessions with good pace"

Toggle AI Search and just ask.

### Know When You're Ready to Train Hard (Apple Intelligence)

TrackRide monitors your recovery and tells you in plain English:

> "You're well-recovered today - great day for an intensive session. Your HRV is up 12% from yesterday and sleep quality was excellent."

Or when you need to take it easy:

> "Consider lighter work today. Your resting heart rate is elevated and you've had three hard sessions this week."

### Smart Notifications That Understand You (Apple Intelligence)

Receive intelligent alerts tailored to your training:

- **After sessions**: Personalised summaries highlighting your achievements
- **Training reminders**: "You haven't trained in 3 days - ready to get back to it?"

## Riding: Complete Equestrian Tracking

### One Tap to Start

**Glove-friendly, always ready.** TrackRide features a large start/stop button designed for riders - approximately 200 points wide, impossible to miss even in thick gloves. Clear visual states show "Ready", "Recording", and "Paused" at a glance.

Strong haptic feedback confirms every action on both iPhone and Apple Watch, so you know it worked without looking.

### Swipe-to-Map View

**See your route in real-time.** During active rides, swipe between the stats display and a live map showing your route with gait-colored polylines:
- Walk segments in green
- Trot segments in blue
- Canter segments in orange
- Gallop segments in red

The map updates as you ride, with a mini stats card showing duration, distance, current gait, and speed at a glance.

### Listen While You Ride

**Your audio, one tap away.** Access your favourite audio apps directly from the riding screen:
- Apple Music
- Spotify
- Apple Podcasts
- Overcast
- Apple Audiobooks
- Audible

Plus playback controls (play/pause, skip) without leaving TrackRide. Perfect for hacking and conditioning rides.

### Exit Without Saving

**Made a mistake? Start fresh.** Swipe left on the pause button to end your ride, then choose to either save or discard. No more cluttered history from accidental starts or test sessions.

### GPS Tracking That Never Quits

Your ride continues recording even when your phone is in your pocket or armband. GPS tracking works reliably in the background, storing timestamped coordinates, speed, and altitude for every point.

Every ride captures:
- Your complete route on a beautiful, colour-coded map
- Total distance and duration
- Speed throughout the ride
- Elevation climbed and descended
- Which horse you rode

### Automatic Gait Detection

**See exactly how you spend your time in the saddle.** TrackRide automatically classifies walk, trot, canter, and gallop from speed and acceleration patterns - no buttons to press, no manual logging.

- **Live gait indicator** with colour coding (walk = green, trot = blue, canter = orange, gallop = red)
- **Post-ride pie chart** showing time in each gait
- **Gait segments** with start/stop time, distance, and average speed

### Track Your Training Balance

**Are you working both reins equally?** Many riders unknowingly favour one direction.

- **Turn tracking** - Uses heading changes to count left vs right turns
- **Balance percentage** - See exactly how biased you are
- **Rein analysis** - Track which rein you're working on during flatwork
- **Canter lead detection** - Know how much time you spent on each lead
- **Training insights (Apple Intelligence)** - AI highlights directional bias and suggests exercises to improve

### Symmetry and Rhythm Scoring

For serious flatwork, TrackRide analyses your movement patterns to give you symmetry and rhythm scores - key indicators of correct, balanced work.

### Elevation Profiles

**See the hills you conquered.** Track cumulative ascent and descent, and view an interactive altitude-over-distance chart after every ride.

### Weather Tracking

**Know the conditions you trained in.** TrackRide automatically captures weather at the start and end of every outdoor session using Apple WeatherKit:

- **Current conditions**: Temperature, feels-like, humidity, wind speed and direction
- **At-a-glance badge**: See temp and conditions while riding
- **Riding conditions assessment**: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, or Dangerous ratings based on temperature, wind, precipitation, and visibility
- **Weather change tracking**: Compare start vs end conditions for longer sessions
- **Historical records**: Every ride stores its weather for trend analysis

Perfect for understanding how weather affects performance, planning future training, and keeping a complete record of your sessions.

### Beautiful Route Maps

Every ride displays on a detailed map with colour-coded sections by gait or speed. Choose standard, satellite, or hybrid views. Clear markers show where you started and finished.

## Keep Your Family Safe

**Riding alone doesn't mean being alone.** Share your location with family members in real-time so they always know where you are.

### Live Family Activity

The redesigned Family Tracking view shows active family rides at the top - tap any rider to view their live map with:
- **Gait-colored route** showing walk, trot, canter, and gallop segments
- **Real-time position** with a pulsing rider marker
- **Live stats** including distance, duration, speed, and current gait
- **Safety warnings** when someone has been stationary too long

### Easy Setup

Clear card-based interface makes it simple to:
- Enable location sharing with one toggle
- Add family members by iCloud email
- See who can view your rides
- Enable safety alert notifications

### Trusted Contacts

**Add emergency contacts for quick access during incidents:**
- **Contact cards** - Each trusted contact displayed with photo, name, and phone number
- **One-tap calling** - Call any contact directly from the app
- **Granular permissions** - Control what each contact can access:
  - View your live location during rides
  - Receive safety alerts when you're stationary

  - Access your ride history
- **Easy management** - Add contacts from your address book, remove with swipe or tap

### Live Location Sharing

Your family can open TrackRide and see:
- Your current position on a live map (updates every 10-15 seconds)
- Your complete route with gait colors
- Your current speed and gait
- How long you've been riding
- When you last moved

Uses iCloud-based sharing so all family devices stay in sync.

### Automatic Safety Alerts

- **Stationary warning** - Notification after ~2 minutes of no movement with quick actions to call or view map
- **Urgent alert** - Escalated high-priority notification after ~5 minutes
- **Auto-clear** - Alerts dismiss automatically once movement resumes

### Fall Detection

TrackRide uses a 2-phase detection algorithm to identify probable falls:

**Phase 1: Impact Detection**
- High acceleration spike (>3G impact) or rapid rotation (>5 rad/s)
- Signal filtering reduces false positives from normal riding motion

**Phase 2: Immobility Check**
- Monitors for lack of movement in the 2 seconds following impact
- Impact + immobility = probable fall

**Heart Rate Integration** (with Apple Watch)
- HR spikes increase detection sensitivity by up to 15%
- Stable HR reduces sensitivity, preventing false alarms

**Response Flow**
- "Are You OK?" screen appears with 30-second countdown
- Haptic feedback pulses every 5 seconds, urgent in final 10 seconds
- Tap "I'm OK" to dismiss, or "Get Help" for immediate emergency alert
- No response → automatic emergency notification with your exact GPS location

**Dual-Device Detection** (with Apple Watch)
- Both iPhone and Watch detect falls independently
- If either device detects a fall, both show the alert
- Wrist-based alert with large glove-friendly buttons
- Redundant sensing means better coverage in all riding positions

Set up trusted contacts - partners, parents, yard managers - with one-tap calling from the emergency screen.
